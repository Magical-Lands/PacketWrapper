This is an unofficial version of PacketWrapper for ProtocolLib. Unfortunately, support for this has long since been discontinued. 
However, since I use ProtocolLib for my network, I need an up-to-date PacketWrapper. 
I will update the packets to version 1.21.4 bit by bit, as needed. Feel free to make changes here as well.

The project is published to GitHub Packages with the group ID dev.magicallands and the artifact ID packetwrapper.
It is intended to be consumed in other projects using shadowing.
